# Snake Game

This ASCII terminal-based snake game was written using built-in Python libraries including [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) for the terminal display and input handling. The Snake object can be constructed with custom length, segment configuration, and display characters. The World object can be constructed with custom starting snake position, height, width, and food display character, but all of these have defaults.
